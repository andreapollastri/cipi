# ── Deploy log framing ───────────────────────────────────────
# /home/<app>/logs/deploy.log is written by both paths: `cipi deploy` (root)
# and the per-minute webhook trigger cron (cipi-app-deploy, app user). Raw
# Deployer output carries no dates and no release markers, so a deploy that
# failed overnight was unreadable after the fact. Every line gets a wall-clock
# timestamp, and each run is bracketed by a start/end banner naming the
# trigger, the branch, the release and the duration.

# Defensive on the argument: called from several places now, and under
# `set -u` a missing one would kill the whole process with an opaque
# "$1: unbound variable" instead of failing where the mistake is.
