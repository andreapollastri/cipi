## [3.x] - Previous Versions

Previous versions (1.x, 2.x, 3.x) were Laravel-based web applications. See [legacy branch](https://github.com/andreapollastri/cipi/tree/3.x) for older versions.

## Migration Guide (3.x ‚Üí 4.0)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Cipi 4.0 is a complete rewrite and is **not compatible** with previous versions.

If you're running Cipi 3.x or earlier:

1. **Backup** all your data and configurations
2. **Export** all your virtual host configurations
3. **Fresh install** Cipi 4.0 on a new server
4. **Manually recreate** virtual hosts using the new CLI
5. **Migrate** your applications and databases

We recommend setting up Cipi 4.0 on a fresh server rather than trying to upgrade in place.
